# Worldview Integration: [Topic]

> This document connects the four scenarios developed in Phases 1-6 back to the user's worldview captured in Phase 0. The goal is to help them understand how each scenario relates to their existing mental model, not to persuade them to change their view.

## Your Beliefs Across Scenarios

### Belief: "[Core prediction from worldview_model.md]"

| Scenario | How This Belief Fares |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Scenario A:** [Name] | [Confirmed / Challenged / Irrelevant - explanation] |
| **Scenario B:** [Name] | [Confirmed / Challenged / Irrelevant - explanation] |
| **Scenario C:** [Name] | [Confirmed / Challenged / Irrelevant - explanation] |
| **Scenario D:** [Name] | [Confirmed / Challenged / Irrelevant - explanation] |

**Crux:** [What determines which scenario unfolds regarding this belief]

### Belief: "[Second key belief from worldview_model.md]"

| Scenario | How This Belief Fares |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Scenario A:** [Name] | [Analysis] |
| **Scenario B:** [Name] | [Analysis] |
| **Scenario C:** [Name] | [Analysis] |
| **Scenario D:** [Name] | [Analysis] |

**Crux:** [What determines which scenario unfolds regarding this belief]

## Expert Perspectives on Your Worldview

### Where Specialists See It Differently

*Specialist reactions to the user's worldview - framed as additional perspectives, not corrections.*

**[Specialist Name]:**
> [Reaction to user's worldview - what they'd want the user to consider]

## Your Cruxes as Scenario Boundaries

*How the user's stated uncertainties map to the scenario axes.*

| Your Crux | Scenario Boundary |
|-----------|------------------|
| [Crux 1 from worldview_model.md] | Separates [Scenarios X/Y] from [Scenarios Z/W] |
| [Crux 2 from worldview_model.md] | Determines whether [outcome A] or [outcome B] |

## Reflection

*User's updated thinking after the scenario planning process. This is exploratory, not evaluative.*

**Has anything shifted in how you're thinking about this?**

[To be captured during Phase 7 reflection conversation]

**Any scenarios that felt more plausible than expected?**
